/**
 * The AstarStrategy class is an extension of the abstract NavPathStrategy class. For our navigation system, you can
 * now specify and define your own pathfinding strategy. Originally, the two options were to use Djikstras or a
 * direct (point A -> point B) strategy. The only way to change how the pathfinding was done was by hard-coding things
 * into the classes associated with the navigation system.
